## File Resource Provider Plugin

This is a contrived but functional example of a Fiat `ResourceProvider` and `Resource` plugin. It depends
on pending changes to Fiat.

It allows Fiat to serve permissions about a file, where permissions are derived from the file's group permissions.

## Configuration

```
file:
  path: /path/to/file
```
